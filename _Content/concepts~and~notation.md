Assume that a ***community*** $\cmy$ of $n$ participants Â ($n$ is at least two) decides by choosing an option from the set of possible choices $\dec=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$, here $m\geq 2$.
Further, we use the term an ***actor*** to refer to a community participant.

The decision is either one of the possible choices or refusing to choose.

We interpret refusing as choosing 0 from the extended set of choices $\edec=\{0,1,\ldots,m\}$.

It is assumed that a collective decision is the voting based on the community participants' decisions.

Each participant's decision is based on his idea of how acceptable this or that choice is for him.

Since the preference for one choice over another is not absolute, the $k$-th participant's preference system is described by a probability row vector $\boldsymbol{w}^k=(w^k_1,\ldots,w^k_m)$, whose $i$-th component is the probability choosing $i$ by this participant.
This vector is further called the ***preference vector*** of the participant.

We also use the notation $\Delta_m$ to refer to the simplex of preference vectors for $m$ possible choices.

Now, the current state of the participant preferences is described by the point of $\Delta_m$ for the corresponding $m$.
